A .class file is a compiled .java file.

.java is all text and is human readable.
.class is binary (usually).

You compile a java file into a class file by going to the command line, navigating to the .java file, and running

javac "c:\the\path\to\your\file\yourFileName.java"
You must have a java SDK installed on your computer (get it from Oracle), and make sure the javac.exe file is locatable in your computer's PATH environment variable.
